Description: Sawdagen generates weather data for weather stations located
    at 12 major Australian airports. A monthly weather condition Markov Chain is
    learnt for each station from 1 years worth of historical weather data downloaded
    through the weatherunderground.com API. Daily temperature, pressure and humidity are
    modelled through a random sample drawn from monthly weather condition probability
    distributions measured at each station. These data are then projected onto
    stations through their monthly conditions at a daily level determined by the
    Markov Chain.
